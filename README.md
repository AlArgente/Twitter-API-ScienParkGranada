# TwitterAPI-Test
Repository to test de Twitter API

The code in **app_hashtag** will be used in the *Artificial Intelligence exhibition at the Granada Science Park* from **November 15, 2022**.
The code in **app_user** will be improved to be ready for exhibition by **January 2023**.

I don't upload the credentials.py file. The credentials must be obtained in the developer portal.

To run the app_hashtag.py file it is necessary to have and advanced credentials in order to add data to the database.
For the database I use **SQLite**, I used *SQL* but **SQLite** it's better for the
requirements that the app has.

Once you have SQLite installed, you need to create the *test.db* file, archive for the database. I added
an empty one for a faster deployment.
