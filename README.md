# TwitterAPI-Test
Repository to test de Twitter API

I don't upload the credentials.py file. The credentials must be obtained in the developer portal.

To run the app_hashtag.py file it is necessary to have and advanced credentials in order to add data to the database.
For the database I use **SQLite**, I used *SQL* but **SQLite** it's better for the
requirements that the app has.

Once you have SQLite installed, you need to create the *test.db* file, archive for the database. I added
an empty one for a faster deployment.

The file "descriptions_of_emojis.csv" was took from the repository: https://github.com/cristinazuhe/Emojis_Description/blob/master/descriptions_of_emojis.csv
